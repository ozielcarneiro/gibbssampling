This program was created for an assignment for the Probabilistic Reasoning course at USC in April 2013 using C++. The assignment requested to create a program able to perform the Gibbs Sampling approximation algorithm over a given binary Bayesian Network, however as I was already coding a binary Bayesian Network framework I decided to use it and therefore the code is generic and can be used to compute marginal and conditional probabilities for each node in the network.

Right now the tree information, such as, nodes, relations and observations, are hard coded in the main class, so to use the code for a different tree from the one used in the main.cpp file it is necessary to change the code. It shouldn't be complicated, it is just necessary to point out that when inserting conditional probability values to each node their position in the table are related as the parents binary assignment, so for a node X with parents Y and Z, the position 0 corresponds to Y=0 and Z=0, being the most significant bit the first parent added.

The algorithm applies the concept of mixing discarding the initial 2% of the samples if a convergence threshold is not satisfied. The mixing will keep discarding samples until the threshold is satisfied.
